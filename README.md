# ConsumerProducer
Simple consumer producer example. Coding style inspired by Bob Martin's Clean Code and Kent Beck's Implementation Patterns.

I included the tests directly into the project. Why? Well I don't want to waste time building up parallel directory structures. I usually have this dupplicate structure, however it usually means that I have to move more files around every time I refactor and without any benefit.
